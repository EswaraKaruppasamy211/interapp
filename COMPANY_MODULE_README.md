# SkillBridge Company Recruiter Module - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document provides a complete guide to the SkillBridge Company Recruiter Module - a comprehensive ATS (Applicant Tracking System) and recruitment platform that integrates with the existing Student Module.

## Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Technology**: Node.js HTTP Server (native, no Express)
- **Authentication**: JWT Token-based
- **Database**: SQLite with in-memory state management
- **Data Isolation**: 100% multi-tenant company isolation
- **API Pattern**: RESTful endpoints under `/api` namespace

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology**: Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **UI Framework**: Custom CSS with glassmorphism design
- **API Integration**: Fetch-based with JWT auth headers
- **Role-Based Navigation**: Student, Company, College Admin portals

## Integration Steps

### Step 1: Backend Integration
The company APIs are already integrated into `/backend/server.js` (lines 1461-1655). No additional action needed - the server includes:
- All company endpoints with proper authentication
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- AI matching algorithms (reused from student module)
- State management and persistence

### Step 2: Frontend Integration
To add remaining UI screens to index.html:

1. Copy all HTML sections from `frontend/company-screens-extension.html`
2. Insert before the closing `</main>` tag in index.html
3. Ensure `frontend/company-module.js` is loaded (already done)

### Step 3: Frontend Function Implementations
Add these functions to `frontend/app.js` navigateTo() handler:

```javascript
else if (viewId === 'company-jobs-list') loadCompanyJobsList();
else if (viewId === 'candidate-comparison') loadCandidateComparison();
else if (viewId === 'assessment-builder') loadAssessmentBuilder();
else if (viewId === 'interview-scheduler') loadInterviewScheduler();
else if (viewId === 'offer-management') loadOfferManagement();
else if (viewId === 'recruitment-analytics') loadRecruitmentAnalytics();
else if (viewId === 'campus-recruitment') loadCampusRecruitment();
else if (viewId === 'team-management') loadTeamManagement();
```

## Database Schema

### Key Data Structures

```javascript
state = {
  // Existing
  users: [],           // All users (students, companies, admins)
  companies: [],       // Company profiles
  jobs: [],           // Job postings
  applications: [],   // Job applications
  
  // Company-specific
  companyAssessments: {       // Keyed by companyId
    'CMP-10001': [assessment]
  },
  companyInterviews: {        // Keyed by companyId
    'CMP-10001': [interview]
  },
  companyOffers: {            // Keyed by companyId
    'CMP-10001': [offer]
  },
  teamMembers: [],            // Team members across all companies
  companyCampusDrives: {      // Keyed by companyId
    'CMP-10001': [drive]
  },
  messages: []                // Company to student messages
}
```

## AI Algorithms

### Candidate Matching
The system uses `calculateCompanyMatch(studentId, company)` to determine candidate fit:
- Skills Match: 70% weight
- CGPA Match: 30% weight
- Returns: Match percentage, strengths, gaps, recommendations

### AI Employability Score
The `calculateSkillScore(studentId)` function computes overall readiness:
- CGPA: 40 points
- Skills: 30 points
- Certifications: 15 points
- Projects: 15 points
- Backlogs penalty: -10 per backlog

## Authentication Flow

### Company Login
1. User enters: Company Name, Email, Password
2. System finds user with role='company' and matching companyId
3. Generates JWT token with userId, email, companyId, role
4. Token stored in localStorage
5. All API requests include Authorization header: `Bearer {token}`

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
Every company endpoint checks:
```javascript
const authUser = getAuthUser();
if (!authUser || authUser.role !== 'company') return sendJSON(401, ...);
// Filter all data by authUser.companyId
```
